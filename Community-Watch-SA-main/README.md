üöÄ How to Use
The application is designed to be straightforward for community members.

Report an Incident:

Go to the "Report Incident" page.

Fill in the details about the incident. You can use the "Get Current Location" button to automatically populate latitude and longitude.

Click "Submit Report."

Important: Your reported incident data (type, date, time, location, etc.) is saved locally in your browser's storage (localStorage) and will be displayed on the "News" page under "Your Reported Incident Statistics." This data is specific to your browser and device and is not sent to a server for storage.

View Your Statistics:

Visit the "News" page.

Scroll down to the "Your Reported Incident Statistics" section to see charts visualizing the types and trends of incidents you've reported.

Access Resources: The "Resources" page provides useful information and videos for community safety.

üõ† Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web pages.

CSS3: Styling and responsive design.

JavaScript: Core interactivity, form handling, and data management.

Chart.js: For rendering interactive data visualizations on the "News" page.

EmailJS: Integrated into the "Report Incident" form to send incident details via email (requires configuration with your EmailJS service ID and template ID).

Web Geolocation API: To capture the user's live location on the "Report Incident" form.

localStorage: Used for client-side storage of reported incident data for personalized statistics on the "News" page.
